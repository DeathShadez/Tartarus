# **Tartarus**
A Minecraft Terra generation pack that adds a ton of new biomes to the Nether!

Tartarus is a Terra world generation pack for Minecraft Java v1.19 that adds 12 custom biomes to the Nether! This includes vanilla biomes, however these biomes have been reworked to fit the scheme of this pack better. 

> **THIS PACK IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION YET**

Tartarus currently does not include any naturally generating ores and may contain bugs. As long as this warning is still here, this pack is not completed yet.

## Credits
Tartarus was made possible only through the help and support from the PolyhedralDev team, as well as the default Overworld config packaged with Terra, which some edited configs can be found in various assets in Tartarus. You can check out the pack here: https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/TerraOverworldConfig

## Installing this pack
> Currently, you are only able to use this on Bukkit. While you technically *could* install this on other platforms, you have no option to generate this in the Nether. If you want to use this pack on Fabric, Forge, or other supported platforms, and you don't mind having Nether terrain in the Overworld, feel free to use this pack.

Simply install this pack like any other Terra generation pack. Simply add these lines to the end of `Bukkit.yml`. The ID of the pack is `TARTARUS`. However, rather than specifying the pack to generate in `world`, you would insert `world_nether`:

```
worlds:
  world_nether:
    generator: Terra:TARTARUS
```

Obviously, if your Nether world name is named something different, you would rename it to that instead.

## Biome List
> Currently I haven't taken proper updated pictures of each biome yet, but I'm planning on making a list of all the biomes and some descriptions of them in the Wiki page of this repository.

## Minor Pack Configuration
> Again, this information will be presented in the Wiki page of this repository once I find the time to do so.

## Bugs and Features
If you find any bugs in this pack, feel free to report them in the Issues page! Likewise, if you have any feature requests such as biome additions, etc, feel free to post those as well!
